# Nice to meet you!

Between Aug 2024 - Dec 2025, I was a graduate student at Arizona State University (ASU) pursuing a **master of science in user experience** with a special interest in accessibility. After graduating, I became a Technical Writer at my dream company, ServiceNow, to kickstart my tech career. ✨

In my last semester (Fall 2025), I took GIT 598 Special Topics - Introduction to Web Coding. At the time of writing (first week of classes), I have found that I enjoy seeing my coding work come to life; as a designer, I can create the ideas, and as a developer, I can actually implement them. I value this greatly as it will help me to understand my coworkers more and be able to (somewhat) meet them where they are at.

Some hobbies:
1. 🏹 This past year, I've been learning archery!
2. 🎮 I built my own computer in order to play videogames with my friends.
3. 🎓 My first career was in education, and I am passionate about bridging gaps. Feel free to visit [my website](https://beccawoo.github.io) to learn more about my journey.
4. 🐁 I have a chinchilla as a pet!
5. 🙃 My whole family is comprised of software engineers. As a rebellious teen, I tried to avoid tech, but it really does align with my interests and passions best. So here I am!

While exploring some options for widgets I could put into this, I found this joke generator that I thought was silly.
